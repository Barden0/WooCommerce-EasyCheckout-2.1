# WooCommerce EasyCheckout 2.1

This is an updated version of [**WooCommerce EasyCheckout**](https://github.com/Barden0/WooCommerce-EasyCheckout) — designed to give you more control over which billing fields to hide during checkout when selling digital products.

---

## Why a New Version?

The original plugin was intentionally minimalistic to offer a zero-configuration solution. This version is ideal for users who want **more flexibility** and a **WordPress admin settings page** for customization.

---

## Features

✅ **Smart Product Detection**  
- **Digital Products Only**: Only asks for name and email. All selected billing fields are hidden.  
- **Physical Products**: All billing fields are displayed.  
- **Mixed Cart**: All billing fields are displayed to allow shipping.

✅ **Admin Settings Page**  
- Select which billing fields (address, postcode, phone, etc.) you want to hide for digital-only carts.  
- Changes are applied without touching code.

✅ **User-Friendly**  
- Easily configurable via the WordPress dashboard under Settings → Woo EasyCheckout.
